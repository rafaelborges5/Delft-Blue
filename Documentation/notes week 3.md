### Feedback for diagram on mattermost
- Introduce the same level of detail for all components
- Maybe merge notifications into users
- Think about how requests go through microservices
- Connect related components from different microservices

### Gitlab
- Put everything on gitlab - issues, all docs, etc
- Merge into main before every meeting
- Issues for non-programming tasks, such as making architecture diagram, etc
- Do sprint retrospectives, try https://easyretro.io/

### Other
- Gateway balances traffic by deciding where to forward each request
- Join auth and users, or not - bot are valid options
- Kafka is pain to set up, but then we will get high-fives from TA
- We do not need ACL
- We can decide when to start programming; however better not to leave everything for last week
