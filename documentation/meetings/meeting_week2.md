# Minutes meeting 1

## Communication
- Weekly meetings:
    * give progress update
    * have agenda (chairman + note-taker)
    * official stuff - mattermost 
    * other stuff - discord

## Contributions
- gitlab:
    * docs folder
    * issue tracking (tags + statuses)
    * put everything to gitlab:)
    * try to contribute equally
- MOSCOW - split into tasks weekly
- 2 reviewerts per MR


## Next week
- start with requirements engineering
- - || - diagrams
- start with general structure of gitlab ( set up CI/CD pipeline)
- draft of assignment
- ask any questions before deadline

## Others
- Checkstyle in gitlab
- if we want to use Kafka or any other microservices frameworks, we can
- start on early (should have majority of the project before Christmas)
- Would be nice to have a code of conduct

## Testing
- integration tests should be done
- end to end tests should be done (not that much)
- mutation testing

## Diagrams
- should show the communication
- UML (follow schema from the lecture)
- DDD
- deadline week 5

## Questions
- resources go to the faculty 
- populate the database (there are resources when program starts)
    * for testing have it prepoluated
- resources are just units
- First diagram seems fine
- What kind of data needed when "remove the node" so that we figure out where to put in the nodes.
- Password requirement is non-functional
- Split-resource requirements: 
    * there are resources
    * there are 3 types
    * constraints on types
- Start with description of node (and then the constraints)
- push some more requirements from should haves to could haves
- Won't have: GUI (+ find others in the doc)
- Limited amount of resources is not really a requirement (it follows from there are resources)

## Grading
- testing is a big part
- gitlab usage also important
- design patterns is important + implementing them
