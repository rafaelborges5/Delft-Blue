* Assignment 2 and 3 dont count towards the project, and we cant do any coding after the 23rd realted to the project. This is the final deadline towards the actual code.
* Dont forget to celebrate Christmas!!!
* We should focus on getting the last issues done and testing and getting evrything working together.


* Strategy Design Pattern
** We shouldnt show things not related to the design pattern - only relevant stuff
** Ignore non relevant classes in sush a case
** We arent supposted to represent functionality in such a diagram, so no connection needed between

* Facade Deisgn Pattern
** how is it advantageous over not doing said pattern? -> in case of switching controllers, such as from kafka to synchronous (thats good). Also simplifies the work of the controller.
** Sounds ok
** Might be slightly late with the design patterns so we should be careful


* Requirements Analysis
** UPLOAD the actual requirements to main
** listener for request should be worked on properly and completed
** adding requests isnt connected properly, should be done for tests
** still need to make the connection between faculty and resource manager
** If the design patterns are implemented well, we have a great grade in the software engineering rubric

* Jyotir and Jasper are behind on lines of code in the actual project, so they should push some changes and create some merge requests to boost those numbers

* Testing
** Almost 90% : thats good and enough
** mostly unit tests
** 1 integration test for gateway, so add more of them if possible
** implement some system tests as well
** System tests should be easy as well: use postman and export them to the project
