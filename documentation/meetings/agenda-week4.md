# Questions for the TA

- Feedback on draft of Task 1 assignment 1, submitted on Friday
- Check that we didn't miss any information regarding pros and cons of each of the considered design patterns (facade, builder, singleton). Are they useful?
- How to test in Kafka - follow up with what we did already
- Can we disable PMD, another checkstyle framework? We had problems with it alerting that we didn't close the serializers...
- "Request should have name and description", says the scenario description. Is this necessary? Or could we have just description
- Should we do the whole class diagram for the entire system for task 2 assignment 2? Or should we do other type of diagram? What was the type of diagram that you showed us in the first meeting? (the larger one)
- What should be part of the domain module vs the models module?
- What is the node token mentioned in the scenario domain specs?
- What does the build.gradle group property do?

# Question round

*Are there any more questions?*

# Closing

That is it, any other general remarks?
